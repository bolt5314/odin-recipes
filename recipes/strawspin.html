        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This strawberry spinach banana smoothie is my latest and greatest healthy green smoothie. It’s creamy, fruity, filling, and not too sweet. I drink it most often for breakfast or after a workout to refuel. I know you are going to love how it makes you feel and how it tastes too!</p>
        <p>Stock these items in your refrigerator and freezer, and a fast healthy smoothie can be yours in fewer than five minutes. Each ingredient gives the strawberry spinach smoothie benefits.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strawberries.</strong> Naturally sweet, fruity, and an excellent source of vitamin C, folate, manganese, and potassium too. For this recipe, used frozen strawberries to ensure the smoothie texture was nice and thick.</li>
                <li><strong>Spinach.</strong> Spinach is so healthy in smoothies! It’s low in carbs and high in fiber and nutrients. Although the spinach turns the smoothie a tell-tale color, it is ultra mild. This green smoothie doesn’t taste green.</li>
                <li><strong>Pineapple.</strong> A few cubes of frozen pineapple can completely transform the taste of a smoothie, especially green smoothies. Pineapple makes the spinach totally imperceptible and gives the smoothie a lightly tropical flair. Pineapple is packed with Vitamin C, manganese (a natural mineral that promotes growth), and antioxidants.</li>
                <li><strong>Banana.</strong> Adding frozen banana to smoothies makes them extra thick, rich, and creamy without the need to add ice. Plus banana is rich in fiber and antioxidants while being low in calories. If you prefer to make this strawberry spinach smoothie with no banana, you can omit it and add additional fruit and a small handful of ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Almond Milk.</strong> My smoothie-go to. As written, this is a vegan strawberry spinach smoothie (no dairy), but feel free to use any milk you like.</li>
                <li><strong>Chia Seeds.</strong> These little seeds are a loaded with antioxidants, Omega-3 fatty acids, and high levels of protein and fiber. No chia seeds on hand? Swap them for a different high fiber or high protein addition to help keep the smoothie filling. Greek yogurt, nut butter, or protein powder are all great choices.</li>            
            </ul>

        <h2>Adding Spinach to Smoothies</h2>
        <p>I often hear concerns from those who are new to green smoothies about if you can taste the spinach in smoothies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You CANNOT taste spinach in smoothies, as long as you add other naturally sweet ingredients. Pineapple and banana are especially effective at disguising the taste of spinach.</li>
                <li>Spinach should be added to smoothies raw. You can add it right from the refrigerator or add frozen spinach. Have a carton of spinach in your fridge about to go bad? Freeze it in a ziptop bag now, then add it to your smoothie later.</li>
                <li>You can add spinach to smoothies even when the recipe doesn’t call for them. Because you can’t taste the spinach in smoothies in moderate quantities, it won’t alter the flavor of the smoothie and will make it even more healthy for you!</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>At first glance, creme brulee seems simple: It has a short ingredient list and can be made in a few steps.</p>
            <p>Beneath the surface, however, there's a lot happening! Understanding the techniques needed to create creme brulee will help make your next batch a success.</p>

            <p>At its most basic, creme brulee is a creamy, pudding-like, baked custard with a brittle top of melted sugar that cracks when you gently tap it with a spoon. <strong>The custard is made with heavy cream, eggs, sugar, and vanilla.</strong> The melted sugar crust will be slightly warm or room temperature when served, but the custard below should be cold.</p>
            <p>You can dress up a batch of creme brulee by adding caramel or fruit on the bottom, but the classic version is plain vanilla.</p>
            <p><strong>Part of the joy of eating creme brulee is a study in contrast:</strong> You use the edge of your spoon to gently crack the hard sugar surface, in order to expose the creamy custard beneath. Youâ€™ll get a little crunchy topping and custard in each bite.</p>

        <h2>Making Creme Brulee</h2>
            <p>Before we dive into the details, here's the basic outline of how to make creme brulee:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the custard.:</strong> Warm the cream, sugar, and a vanilla bean in a saucepan. In a bowl, whisk together yolks and some additional sugar. Slowly whisk the warm cream into the yolks, and remove the vanilla bean. This is your custard and the base for the creme brulee.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake the custard.:</strong> Divide this custard mixture between several ramekins, place in a hot water bath, and bake until the custard is set, but still jiggly. Chill the custards.</li>
                <li><strong>Torch the top to caramlize:</strong> Just before serving, sprinkle the surface with a little sugar and use a creme brulee torch to caramelize the sugar and form a brittle crust.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That's it!</p>
